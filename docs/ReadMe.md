Building out an MVP product for the TeleHealth project
objective:  have ready by tomorrow
            revise flowchart to understand functionality required
            review documentation for full project scope

Tech Stack:
Frontend / Backend:  NextJS (framework), REACT(library), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
RAILWAY (for deployment)
HONO (for transcription service)
AI Model: On Replicate web platform / Whisper AI or any suitable model
Authentication: BetterAuth

Focus On:
Building out process for doctor using session hub, being able to record, create a patient profile, review/revise transcripts, upload recordings and files, edit / manage patient profiles

Overview:
A secure, web-based telehealth and electronic medical records (EMR) application designed for doctors serving patients in Jamaica’s underserved and storm-affected communities.

What it is:
A browser-based app (phone/tablet/computer) where clinicians can:
Log in securely
View and update patient profiles
Conduct telehealth consultations (video and/or audio)
Record and store clinical encounters as structured medical records

What it’s used for:
Enabling remote consultations when patients can’t easily access in‑person care
Capturing complete visit history:
Demographics and contact details
Past medical history, current complaints, medications, surgeries
Visit notes generated from recorded conversations using AI transcription
Providing a single, secure record that can be reused by multiple doctors over time
Supporting missions work (e.g., Christiana Friday missions) with consistent data capture
Impact / Why it matters
Expands access to qualified doctors (including international volunteers) for patients in remote or disaster-affected areas
Reduces reliance on paper charts and fragmented records, improving continuity of care
Frees doctors to focus on the patient instead of typing, by using AI to structure notes
Lays the foundation for future integration with:
Jamaican Ministry of Health systems
Local pharmacies and labs
Decision support (e.g., suggested diagnoses, labs, and medication safety checks)
