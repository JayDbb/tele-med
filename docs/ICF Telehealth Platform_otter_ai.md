Dennis Wilmot  0:17  
Oh, I Hey, Guys. I

Daniel Callaghan  1:25  
you're muted. Daniel, hey guys, sorry. Since guys, I'm actually here on the site. But yeah, I just wanted to say that Dennis, Dana and Nick and chevenix, you guys have been doing great work. I see the stuff that you guys have been doing, but I'm just not at the moment able to comment on everything as yet, because I haven't gone through so for right now, I guess everything you guys should just talk to Dennis here. I guess Dennis, I've been doing a good stuff a lot, right? Right? Dennis, I didn't hear that. Bro, yeah, I'm basically telling them that you've been, you've been you've been you've been doing everything. They've been doing a good job, and you've been managing everything, and you'll be managing things for a little while now. I also heard that.

Dennis Wilmot  2:20  
Evening repeater, no, no, continue.

Daniel Callaghan  2:25  
Yeah. I'm also hearing that the scope from Ilya might need to be adjusted as well. What was talking about that? I don't know how you guys feel about your scope. How do you guys feel right now about the current, next version that you guys need to make?

Dennis Wilmot  2:41  
Oh, it's it's fine, is it? Is it? You can discuss that another time.

Daniel Callaghan  2:47  
Okay, this call is for something else. My bad, my boy for invading guys. All right, I'm gonna check out now because I'm at the bank. Big up. Get you guys doing a good job. Justin. Big up, yourself, bro. Laugh.

Ilya Rabkin  3:02  
I don't laugh. Why was he laughing?

Dennis Wilmot  3:13  
Nick, how's it going, Bro, did you I heard that you're rushing to finish the video portion. How far did you reach it? See they are joining us.

Dennis Wilmot  3:42  
Yoni, you heard me? Yeah, I can hear you. I was asking, how far did you reach with the video, implementing the video,

Nicholas McKay  4:01  
yeah, I was making some changes. Just know I was making Oh, can you hear me now? Yeah, I can hear Yeah. I can hear Yeah. I was making some changes just now about running into some errors, so won't be able to do a demo right away.

Nicholas McKay  4:31  
Yeah, no problem. But, like, what have you? Where do you?

Nicholas McKay  4:37  
Oh, yeah, we can't. We can't get actual video call working between two, two devices, peer to peer, devices integrated into the app. So,

Nicholas McKay  4:54  
yeah, so the main functionality of entering the video conference, that's what we have, just tailor it and add all the features that we need on the page, like the charts and stuff like that.

Ilya Rabkin  5:16  
You're muted. Ilya, yeah, I clicked the wrong link. My apologies. No problem. I was like, where is everybody?

Dennis Wilmot  5:33  
I'm in Manchester.

Ilya Rabkin  5:35  
No, no, no, no, I was I clicked the wrong link and was waiting there. Thank you. But never mind, never mind. We're all good. All right. How's everyone doing? Pretty good. Okay. All right, so thanks everyone for being here. I know we're just continuing the work on the platform, kind of leading off from previous conversation about what happened on Friday and kind of take homes and learning. So we're moving along. I took a look at that patient hub and shivanisa. Thank you for putting that together. That was pretty cool. I guess what would make sense is maybe I know I sent that print out of my thoughts and feedback. Do you want to go over it now? Kind of hearing what I have to say as we move through it, or what would you prefer I give you at this point?

Dennis Wilmot  6:42  
I yeah, you can Chevy, can share the document, and then we can just have you walk us through the feedback that you provided. Yeah,

Ilya Rabkin  7:00  
or do you want me kind of so we could go through the document, or I could pull up the platform?

Shevanise Givans  7:07  
Yeah, you can pull it up on your screen and tell us, like, step by step, what you like to change, or what's

Ilya Rabkin  7:14  
kind of impressions. Yeah, the reason so let me. I'll share my screen. So

Ilya Rabkin  7:29  
all right, you all see where I am, yes, okay, so nice and clean. So I like this, so this is kind of the initial dashboard for me, right? So I'm Dr Ilya, I log in and this is what I'm seeing. So the initial thing I noticed, so these three, so we have a calendar component, today's timeline and my appointments for the day. So there feels like there's some redundancy here. So I have my appointments for the day, and I see that I'm not sure what today's timeline is, unless it somehow pulls in things like, if I'm lecturing, if I'm away, then maybe, but then that would all be in this calendar. So I'm not sure if we need both of these.

Shevanise Givans  8:43  
So it would be better to take out the today's timeline and then leave the appointments potentially.

Ilya Rabkin  8:48  
Can you tell me what you had in mind with this? Maybe you have some thought that I'm just not thinking about. That would make sense.

Shevanise Givans  8:58  
It was just like for hourly changes, although that does make sense, it's like a replica, like the appointments and in today's timeline. So the appointments will be patient based, and then the today's timeline would be everything you have overall. I didn't want to, like mix them, but that does make sense. When it comes down to it being like a copy. You would see it as a copy, so it would be in the calendar too, so it can be,

Ilya Rabkin  9:24  
yeah, okay. And then the one issue with having things like other things, other things, it means it would be pulling in from another calendar potentially. So we just have to be careful with the security about that, right? But in theory, if it connects to like my personal Google Calendar, then what in theory, if I'm working with someone that's scheduling appointments for me, they would know like, oh, I can't schedule this for Dr Rabkin because he's giving a lecture, whatever. So that's kind of cool, something to think through. It's not a must have, but nature, depending if the security allows for it. Okay, moving on here, this I didn't fully understand. So like patient condition, so for kind of an outpatient where we're out in the field, in a clinic at a person's home, the the stable, serious, fair, critical, I'm not fully understanding the utility if, yes, if and when we have this system set up For the hospital, potentially, like emergency room doctors, ICU doctors, there may be a benefit of having patients flagged under different stability and conditions, and even then it gets tricky. So I'm not sure the purpose of

Shevanise Givans  10:59  
that was added for workflow. I was thinking about was when the nurse would be selecting the patient's condition to send it over into the meeting. So they would select that, hey, this person that's going to do the appointment, they're critical. So on your dashboard, you're able to see that, hey, this you know you have this person is coming over there, critical, stable or fair. However, I do understand what you're saying. So it was just a feature there, in regards to you being able to tell, like, the overall, like Patient List, like who's coming in and what they're coming with. But, yeah,

Ilya Rabkin  11:36  
I see, I see, okay, that makes it. So, what do you think? Right, if there's this appointment list here, if this is sort of much like I'm seeing Amanda Kimber, the nurse roomed her, or whatever, and then green, yellow, red for stability,

Shevanise Givans  11:57  
or so, like, while we already have here, and then just embed it on the calendar, like the smaller letters and colors, and put it like, current, done, upcoming, yeah.

Ilya Rabkin  12:09  
So something like, yeah, this patient was already done. This patient is current or with a nurse or ready for provider. And then in the middle, you could have, if a nurse flags something she wants me to know, kind of put a red like critical, I don't know we could think through that. That's not a bad idea. There's potential there for something. Generally, people who are going to be at the Health Fair. We're going to their house. They're scheduled. They're generally not going to be critical, right? They're generally going to be stable enough to be sitting there waiting for us. So that's where the slight discrepancy comes in. But I like there's potential there. I think that's an interesting thing we could add in a creative way. Does that help? Yes, that's good. Then this, I'm guessing, is sort of, I click on this appointment, it just gives me a quick little tab, right? You're right, yeah, that's cool. This important updates that that's a cool thing to have. It pulls out health ministry information, any major office changes, anything that that's a nice thing. I would say it would be nice to move these widgets around. So maybe I like my calendar here. And you know, Dr Dennis likes his calendar down here, whatever. Okay, the other thing that the search bar, you have it set to search patients, medication, diagnoses. So I was trying to say for a provider seeing patients, you really don't need to search medication or diagnoses, like I was struggling to find a use case. What did you have in mind?

Shevanise Givans  14:15  
So in case, I don't want to say you forget the patient's name, but you know, you have a patient that uses this medication. You could type in the medication, it will pop up. What cases have that medication in it? So instead of like it was just like a alternative. So if you don't remember the patient's name, you could use a medication or the diagnosis. You would have told the patient,

Ilya Rabkin  14:36  
okay, that makes I see the problem there is in theory, if we have a huge system with 1000s of patients like hundreds of them are going to be on the same medicines, yeah, may not be as helpful. Generally, we search by maybe patient date of birth, name or their medical record number, something more unique, yeah, what is interesting? Oh, what is interesting. I think where you is for other views, like administrative views, for research purposes, public health views, someone could search by a diagnosis and get essentially data and demographics on how many people in our system have diabetes, how many people in our system are on other medications. But that might be more beneficial for a different view, not so much for the doctor seeing the patients, where, where they where that may get complicated is if myself, Dr Rabkin, I want to do everything. So one day I'm seeing patients, and then tomorrow I'm doing an analysis of all the patients in Jamaica who have diabetes, so that can cause problems. But maybe there's, like, a different view I would click where things just are targeted for the view. So if I'm wearing my business hat. I'm only seeing financial data from the system if I'm wearing my public health hat. I'm getting only the the dashboard that's set up for that, because, like, this dashboard is just for a person treating patients at the moment. Okay, all right, that helpful, yeah, all right. Calendar that it's so this calendar, I'm assuming you have there, it would put pull up maybe, like my weekly calendar, bigger view for my week or for the moment, right?

Shevanise Givans  17:00  
That was the plan. So I just didn't put it in sinners, yeah? No, that's it.

Ilya Rabkin  17:04  
Yeah. I like that to have the ability to, like, expand on anything. I like that. That's good. Then going into patience. I'm assuming this is patience for the day, right? Yeah, okay, so I go there. This is all my patience for the day. So it's kind of like an expansion of this, but I just get more info, right? I like that. This is this, the number of patients assigned to me. Is this total patients in the system? What is this?

Shevanise Givans  17:40  
It would be for you personally. Okay, so

Ilya Rabkin  17:43  
my own patients assigned to me for whatever reason. Yeah.

Shevanise Givans  17:48  
So is there a use case where a doctor can wants to see other patients like outside of themselves, or is it beneficial to just have your patients

Ilya Rabkin  17:58  
so different scenarios? Yeah. So sometimes, you know, if I have a clinic, I have patients that are mine, right? Dr Rabkin is their doctor, and they're assigned to him, and that's it. But Dr Rabkin sick sometimes, and someone might need to cover for him. So there are other times where you should where another per another doctor, like Dr Dennis's patient, will come see me, because Dr Dennis is busy like I see. So this is sort of like, how many patients are truly assigned to me because I wanted to dive into all of them. Okay, so that's nice. Maybe we label this my patients, my patients. And maybe this is better on the dashboard, because the dashboard is kind of my central command center. So maybe instead of this, we put my patients. One of these could also be something called Open charts, so it's possible. Dr Rabkin got lazy and didn't finish all his notes one day and went out with some friends, so I wouldn't know how many notes I still have to close. Yeah.

Shevanise Givans  19:31  
So the draft was to demonstrate that, so I could just change the name for the drafts for that.

Ilya Rabkin  19:39  
Oh, drafts. Oh this, this, you mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's cool, yeah, just label it open notes or notes to sign, whatever. Pinterest, yeah, if you don't do this, you're fired. But but this would be good in the main dashboard as the big oversight. Okay, okay, Nicholas,

Nicholas McKay  20:26  
you guys can hear me right, yes, yeah. Navigation purposes, I wanted to know the difference between a chart a visit and a medical record. Correlation between them and how we should have them correlate inside the system.

Ilya Rabkin  20:46  
Good question. Often they're kind of interchanged when you're just discussing it. So the medical record chart is generally referring to all of the information for one patient. So for you, your chart or your record would be all the notes that I saw you, for all your medications, all your history, all the labs. That's your chart. That's your record. A visit is a specific instance or specific encounter. So you can call it an encounter. So that's when Nicholas saw Dr Rabkin yesterday, and everything that was done for that encounter is the visit, and the visit is part of the larger chart or record. Does? Does that answer your question? If not, I can clarify.

Nicholas McKay  21:59  
Yeah, that's making sense now. So when we're building a patient profile, basically what a patient will have is a chart to keep record of all interactions with that patient, and then a visit is for specific instances or specific interactions between patient, doctor, patient, nurse,

Ilya Rabkin  22:22  
yeah, We're patient, yeah, we're patient, yeah. Okay. Any other questions?

Ilya Rabkin  22:45  
Hello, these people.

Shevanise Givans  22:52  
You guys still there? Yeah, you were here. I guess no students,

Ilya Rabkin  22:57  
okay, sorry, I think maybe my connection went weird. Anyone have any questions, or should I move on? You can proceed? Okay, yeah, and you guys just interrupt if you have questions, as I'm going now, let's see Deanna, hold on when we look, where's the chat. So, Deanna, you're asking, do we need to differentiate between types of visit first time follow up? Good question. Potentially there are going to be different kind of visit types. So encounter types generally a first time versus a follow up. You generally don't need to really distinguish between that, but you would potentially need to distinguish between a nursing visit, where a person just saw a nurse for whatever reason, a vaccine, a blood pressure check, something simple. When they're seeing a provider. There are different visit types, so there's one type that's your wellness visit, that's kind of your yearly checkup. It's geared to just kind of do everything, basic labs, there's your sick visit, type, you know, sore throat. UTI, whatever, something quick, simple. It's called a sick visit. Or it's called an acute visit, A, C, U, T, E. Then there's a chronic care which is sort of for the patients who are following up, you know, who have diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, and that visits just to review those chronic diseases. So there are different visit types. The reality, or practical reality, for most doctors, is that often patient comes in for one thing, and you end up doing all the above sometimes, but that's okay. So normally that visit type gets put in when that visit is scheduled, so you kind of know beforehand, either the doctor schedules it, or a nurse schedules it, or however it gets scheduled in the system, it's usually okay. You're here for your general yearly checkup. Oh, you're you want to see doctor because you're sick. Oh, you're following up the medications and your visits. So that's sort of how that gets triaged. Okay, all right, thanks, Anna, that was a good question. Alright, I'll continue. So Okay, we're back on this. So this is the today's patients view. We talked about this, moving that. So this info for the individual patients overall, pretty good. I'm assuming the current issue is either why they're here, so maybe kind of referring to deanna's question about the visit type. Maybe that's Oh, sorry,

Ilya Rabkin  26:22  
yeah. So the current issue, why they're here, I'm guessing, is that correct, or does anything else

Shevanise Givans  26:34  
in mind? That's the reason for the current issue? Yeah.

Ilya Rabkin  26:38  
Okay, yeah. So we could recategorize that, because usually they have multiple issues. So you could say, you know, chronic care, follow up medication, refill, follow up sick, visit, whatever, and then medication. So we could keep this. The reality is, a lot of people will be on multiple so may not necessarily need to be there, or if you want to keep like a scroll option, you could do that. But this quick view is nice,

Shevanise Givans  27:17  
and you it has the drag thing you're mentioning. It's not established everywhere, but if you drag, it moves. So if you put her over there, they switch,

Ilya Rabkin  27:27  
okay, yeah, yeah. So that's more important here. Here. It might get confusing. It may make more sense to have them in order of when they're coming. Okay, yeah. And what I would say to have kind of the status similar to here, kind of saying, you know, finished over the patient left, or patients with a nurse, or ready for the top or whatever the low is at the moment having more of that

Shevanise Givans  28:08  
drop down right there status, I guess it should just be bigger, right? So you could click to change, yeah. So put it up there, more visible, because it possible?

Ilya Rabkin  28:23  
No, so this is, sorry, that's a good placement. We would just need to change these options. Okay, this would make sense for more like to highlight kind of, you know, patient didn't show up. So like, if patient with a nurse or patient ready, which tells the doctor, the nurse is already done with them and they're just waiting on me, and then I would go and click with the doctor, and so the nurse knows that's that's more of a workflow for like a traditional office clinic setting, which we may still want to keep, that has its use. It may not always fit into the health fair model or the home mobile visit, but that's okay, you know another that kind of reminds me that another visit type might be home visit. That's its own potential. Visit note type and so Okay, so then I'm going to see this patient. So good view, basic overview here, different tabs. It would be nice to collapse this one and or bring it back if I want to go back to my dashboard, but I'd want to be able to make it disappear so I have more and then cases, the basic overview of the patient's charts, I would love the vitals to be higher, especially if, like, this is a vital the nurse just did for this patient. Right now, it would be nice if this is more front and center, okay, yep, and then this, I'm assuming, is like the patient's background. So if I wanted to dive in to their vitals or like, Huh, what are their all of their allergies? What are all their medications, all their vaccines, problems, family history, this makes sense, surgical, past, medical these would be like their diagnosis that I put in screening. Make sense. It kind of maybe it's flags and tells me, hey, this patient is due for their prostate cancer screening. So I don't forget. That's a nice little reminder of what's been done, what's not been done, colonoscopies, kind of with the dates. So that's nice. Quality Measures has a potential benefit, like, what should I be considering for this patient? That's helpful these three things, history of present illness is essentially what we call, like, the story. When I'm talking to Dennis, like, hey, Dennis, sorry I'm picking on you. But like, why are you here? Dennis tells me, You know I'm here because I have a sore throat for three days. I tried honey didn't help. That's the history of present illness. So this really shouldn't be here. That's a component of the actual note. Same for review of systems, and potentially this. What did you have in mind when you put this here, maybe I saw I could understand better.
